Sending and recieving Gyroscope data via Message Queue and storing them in STL Containers

Objectives-:
    a) Taking a CSV file of Gyroscope and storing in vector
    
    b) Sending the vector from Sender to Receiver through Message Queue.
    
    c) From the Receiver side, extracting the data and storing in STL container.
    

     d) Doing some basic computations with the datas like :
        i ) Finding the greatest data in the Y-axis coloumn.
        
        ii) Finding the average data in the X-axis coloumn.
        
        iii) Finding a specific range in the Z-axis coloumn.

Challenges - : 
    a) We faced issue in converting csv file into object.
    
    b) Implementation of sender and reciever codes.
